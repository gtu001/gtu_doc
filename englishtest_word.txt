If, as Putin asserted, Ukraine was not a real country, it would surely have collapsed by now. But even with 150,000 Russian troops inside its borders, according to US assessments, they control at most about 10% of Ukraine.

Traveling around Ukraine in the three weeks before the invasion, it seemed many people were in denial. "We are certain there will be no war," was the refrain -- in Mariupol, Zaporizhzia and Kyiv. The Ukrainian government also played down the build-up of Russian forces, anxious not to panic its citizens and the markets.

Serious defenses and countless checkpoints have popped up around Kyiv. Ukrainian forces -- to the surprise of many observers -- have been nimble and effective against Russian armor that has struggled to make progress. Small, mobile units that know the territory have cut down Russian convoys. The anti-tank weapons acquired mainly from the US and UK have left smoking hulks on roads across the country. Turkish-made attack drones have been deployed to precise effect.

In the few areas occupied by Russian forces -- even those that are predominantly Russian-speaking -- crowds of hundreds have hurled abuse at bewildered Russian soldiers. They have built mountains of tires to defend their towns and painted over street signs.

Not that the Ukrainians have the upper hand. They can't defeat a vastly superior Russian force, but the evidence so far suggests that -- fortified by weapons and other help flowing across the border from Poland -- they may yet deny Putin victory.

And then, not exactly nothing, but nothing overwhelming. The supposedly awe-inspiring 40-mile column of Russian troops driving in from Belarus sat still, going nowhere -- more trucks than tanks. Ukraine's venerable air defenses did a better-than-expected job in taking out cruise missiles and Russian fighter jets.

In explaining the invasion, Putin argued that Ukraine would otherwise become a platform for the West to invade and destroy Russia. He may have miscalculated the likely response to his attempt to swallow a country that, in his dark rewriting of history, had no right to exist.

NATO itself has rarely seemed so focused, a far cry from the carping that characterized the alliance during Donald Trump's presidency. Truckloads of anti-tank weapons have trundled to Ukraine's border.

Before this invasion, as a raft of international sanctions against Russia was debated, even hawks could only dream of cutting off Russian institutions from the international banking system, hunting down the assets of Russian oligarchs, ending or reducing imports of Russian oil and gas and mothballing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. All have now happened.

One company after another, from McDonalds to Zara to Apple, has severed links with the country -- depriving Russians of the consumer goods they had come to love since the end of communism. The ruble is worth less than half what it was in mid-February.

The great question now is whether a furious Russian leader, despite asserting that the "operation" continues to schedule, doubles down with the vast arsenal at his disposal: ballistic and cruise missiles, devastating rocket systems and thermobaric bombs. Will he turn Kyiv into another Grozny, the Chechen capital razed to the ground during his first year in power?

CIA Director William Burns assessed Tuesday that Putin is "determined to dominate and control Ukraine," and predicted an "ugly next few weeks" with "scant regard for civilian casualties," in the face of opposition from the Ukrainian people.

Ukraine has said no, though Zelensky now seems to acknowledge that Ukraine's dream of joining NATO, enshrined in its constitution, may be even more distant than it was before. For its part, Moscow appears to have dropped its demand for what it has called the de-Nazification and de-militarization of Ukraine -- its absurd phraseology for regime change.

After over three decades of covering Russia, I leave in despair. One man has extinguished the bright hope many once felt

What makes Putin's actions all the more galling is how he executed his plot in plain sight. Distracting with one hand, transfixing attention on diplomacy, even while insisting falsely that his massed troops were carrying out exercises on Ukraine's borders.

Ordinary Muscovites didn't even flinch as he perpetrated this betrayal by marching the nation to war on a cocktail of carefully stewed grievances.

Putin spent years building a false narrative along with his empire. The wishes that he was denied, such as NATO withdrawing to 1997 lines or barring Ukraine from membership, was the West's fault, he claimed. But if Putin did believe Russia's security was threatened, and that the modern western world was pitted against him, the truth was that he never adjusted to the changing dynamics of the 21st century.

Back then a packet of American Marlboro cigarettes waved at the roadside outside the CNN bureau on the imposing Kutuzovsky Prospekt got you a taxi ride, another pack paid for a haircut. Moscow was finally connecting to the world; our bureau had phone lines that I helped install as a young engineer that were direct satellite extensions to our Atlanta switchboard.

During those bright, long summer days, the USSR's last leader Mikhail Gorbachev gave our network permission to erect a stage on Red Square in the center of the Russian capital. We were the first western media to broadcast live from the fabled military parade ground, yards from Lenin's tomb in the shadow of the Kremlin's foreboding brick walls, and were witness to the Soviet Union's last party Congress.

It's a tragedy we are witnessing': How Putin killed off Russia's free press

Seven years later I helped Gorbachev -- who had been ousted from power not long after our Red Square debut, ousted following a coup, and succeeded by the alcoholic Boris Yeltsin -- climb a rickety iron ladder to another live stage at the top of a swanky new western chain hotel where we were covering the elections that year. Democracy seemed at hand.

Nights in Moscow in '97 were wild, with revelers dancing in -- and often on -- the bars. The country was on a ride, with vast fortunes to be made, oligarchs newly minted as gamekeepers turned poachers, KGB apparatchiks became mafia dons acquiring state assets, and Putin was threading his way to power.

In the waning minutes of the 20th century Yeltsin plucked Putin from among the money-corrupted milieu in the Kremlin to replace him as Russian President -- and in return, Yeltsin, who had battled corruption allegations, got immunity from prosecution.

For a while after Putin rose to power at the turn of the millennium, there was a glimmer of the modernizer about Russia's new leader, but that reputation didn't last long. With unbridled passion he soon tapped into nationalism, embraced imperial nostalgia and the conservatism of the Russian Orthodox Church stoked Soviet-era suspicions of westerners and stifled dissent. None of this was done to make Russia a better place in which to live; it just made easier for him to rule.

He quickly shed all vestiges of the liberal skin he readily admits was never his: In his mind, the breakup of the Soviet Union had been a national disaster and one that he intended to right. And though he came to power pledging to eradicate corruption, in reality it only spiraled under his rule.

This year, while I have been in Moscow covering the buildup and outbreak of war in neighboring Ukraine, it became painfully clear to me that, just as the Nazis did in Germany during the 1930s and 40s, Putin has had laws made to his order. And like many a strongman before him, the Russian President is ruthlessly unleashing the compliant and complicit state apparatus that he himself built, to obediently enforce them.

In recent days Moscow's clogged arteries have pulsed to flashing blue lights of police vehicles of every size and shape, from lowly traffic cops to lumbering trucks loaded with recently arrested protesters, their strident sirens insisting other traffic yield to them as they blast their way through.

Putin has shaped the Russian state entirely in his image, a move that will not be easily righted. The majority are cowed, the complicit in too deep to reverse their actions, his sanctioned cronies warned to swallow their anger and take the losses for the team like true patriots.

Putin has sown a bitter harvest, with international condemnation reinforcing his tropes, strengthening his hand by silencing the unwilling. Independent media, on life support since Russian security services allegedly poisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny almost two years ago, is suddenly suffocating under harsh new media laws gagging any criticism, punishable with up to 15 years in prison.

In Moscow there is no need to answer that. On the way to the airport Saturday, I saw what appeared to be Putin's cavalcade storm past at breakneck speed in a blaze of flashing lights and sirens, traffic in his direction barred from the road. It was a timely reminder, if I needed one, of an emperor unchallenged in his domain.

Part of the pain of seeing all this is knowing that so much of Russia's vast wealth of intellect and resources lies untapped. Meanwhile, one man and his cronies is destroying the country.

Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.

"Our assessment right now is that (China is) abiding by the requirements that have been put in place, but we would continue to encourage any country to think a lot about what place they want to -- what role they want to play -- in history as we all look back," Psaki said during a news conference Wednesday.

Sullivan told Bash on Sunday that the US has made it clear to Beijing that there will "absolutely be consequences" for "large-scale" efforts to give the Kremlin a workaround to US sanctions.

Still, Sullivan said that while the US believes "China, in fact, was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something, they may not have understood the full extent of it."

Biden has often talked about his conversations with Xi, frequently recalling the dozens of hours the two leaders spent with each other when they were serving as their country's vice presidents. In his speeches, Biden often likes to recall dining with Xi on the Tibetan Plateau and describing the United States in one word: "possibilities."

During the face-to-face meeting in Rome, Sullivan and Yang will also discuss issues that Biden and Xi went over during their virtual call last year, sources familiar with the matter say. The sources added that this meeting has been in the works for some time, and they don't expect any concrete outcomes from it.

"To compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors," Biden said at his first State of the Union address earlier this month.

"We don't want a real war, the objective is political -- that China is persuaded from an aggressive act like the one that Putin has taken in the last several days and weeks."

Japan's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine differs markedly to its actions after Moscow's attack on Crimea in 2014.

"(The Japanese government) treated it a little bit like an issue for the Europeans and Americans to deal with; that it wasn't really about Japan, but that they'd go along with it," Smith said.

"You hear time and time again, the government say -- 'and alongside our G7 and other international partners, we will coordinate in taking a tough response on this issue' -- they don't want to be seen as out of step," Brown said.

And in a rare move, it also reviewed its guidelines on the transfer of defense equipment overseas, paving the way for the transport of bulletproof vests and helmets to Ukraine.

Russia's attack on Ukraine reveals political fault lines in Asia

But extra defense funding is just one aspect of Japan's armor against an escalation of regional tensions.

Nations that were neutral have provided arms for Ukrainians; governments that had for years missed their NATO defense spending obligations have made spectacular U-turns; and countries that had deep economic ties to Russia have gone further in breaking the link than anyone had seriously envisaged little over a month ago.

(CNN)Western leaders and security agencies are spending huge amounts of resources on getting into Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. It's a futile exercise -- at times when the West has thought Russia's war in Ukraine might be losing steam, Putin has doubled down, sending his forces to bomb maternity hospitals and shelters harboring children.

Either way, an incendiary Stalinesque speech on Wednesday night in which Putin called Russians opposing the war "traitors" marked a change in tone and a sign that not all is going to plan, experts said. Perhaps more worrying, many observers saw it as a sign that the head of the Russian state, facing setback in Ukraine, would take a vengeful turn at home and crack down more forcefully than ever on any sign of dissent.

A journalist who jumped on camera on a state-controlled news program, holding an anti-war sign, has become a cause celebré for free speech in Russia. A renowned ballerina has left the Bolshoi. Russian prisoners of war are calling Putin out for using propaganda to justify the war.

Biden's European trip will be heavy on displays of Western unity but could be light on actions to stop Putin's Ukraine war

Biden warned that Putin had dreams of rebuilding an authoritarian empire going all the way back to his days as a senator from Delaware. On the campaign trail, he said repeatedly that he knew Putin didn't want him to win.

Since the beginning of his time as President, Biden has relied on his sense of the Russian leader to guide his own response. It's even guided the way Biden deals with Putin in their conversations, repeatedly interrupting what he and aides see as the Russian President's strategy of going off on tangents meant to muddle and undermine.

He has moved just as deliberately at home to depoliticize opposition to the invasion of Ukraine so that, even among Republicans, support for Putin has been forced to the fringes so that vilifying the Russian leader has become the one major area of bipartisan agreement since Biden took office. This week Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric by calling the Russian President a "war criminal," a "murderous dictator" and a "pure thug."

Biden thinks he wouldn't be able to keep the current levels of unity -- in the US and around the world -- if Putin sparked the kind of partisan breakdown that he did in 2014, when many top Republicans spoke admiringly of his strength and leadership largely because he was taking on Barack Obama.

Biden hasn't -- as some in his party want -- gone after Trump, brought up the attack on the 2016 elections or attacked Republicans for voting against the former President's first impeachment when Trump leveraged withholding military aid to Ukraine -- in pursuit of dirt on Biden.

Most Republicans -- with a few notable outliers, including Trump's own clear struggle to try to erase the memory that his first response to the invasion was calling Putin "smart" and "savvy" -- have not gone on the attack against Biden, despite many differences among Republicans and Democrats alike about particulars of the President's response.

Republicans have not, though, been convinced on the other part of Biden's strategy: Calling rising fuel costs "Putin's price hike" and "Putin's gas tax" as an attempt to assuage voters.

White House aides are tracking all the Republicans in the House and Senate who are calling for tougher energy sanctions on Russia -- preparing to try to undermine them as hypocrites if they complain about higher gas prices on the campaign trail this fall. But at the same time, Biden himself has kept up outreach to Republican lawmakers.

Putin has been tracking what Biden has been doing and saying about him for years. That includes friendly Russian commentators complaining in 2009 that Biden was a "gray cardinal" secretly orchestrating a tough Obama administration response to Putin's leadership after the then-vice president said Russia was limping along, or a Kremlin spokesman on Thursday saying that Biden's war criminal remark was "unacceptable and unforgivable."

Even as Biden has ramped up what he's been saying about Putin, there's only so far he can go before tripping into the escalation he's so desperately trying to avoid.

Villagers have standing room only, while the elderly have been rushed into a van. "Grandpa, we are here," shouts the daughter of one local, Viktor, from the bus doorway, as he sits a little bewildered in the van. The panic is real; at any moment the shelling could resume, a bombardment that residents say has littered the southern Ukrainian village of Posad-Pokrovske with cluster munitions.

Airstrikes, grad rockets, cluster munitions -- the residents recall two weeks of intense bombardment to which the fabric of Posad-Pokrovske bears witness. Barely a building is unscathed, with most roofs missing, and one house is torn down to shreds of cloth. The village's gas main has burst, with the intense hissing of a leak a stark reminder that the tiny settlement is no longer fit for life.

Damaged Ukrainian armor sits outside Posad-Pekrovske, and along the road the signs of days of fighting pepper the landscape. Russian shelling also finds its target regularly, with rockets landing near the highway on several occasions witnessed by CNN, the brush set aflame. Ukrainian artillery was also observed in action Sunday, firing toward the north of Kherson.

The Ukrainian progress has refreshed life in the city of Mykolaiv, with stores reopening and usurping the fear of encirclement that haunted the past week. Vitaly Kim, the regional head whose regular Telegram messages have rallied Mykolaiv to wartime unison and also alerted the city to daily changing threats, has appeared more relaxed. On Saturday, Kim posted pictures of a pair of socks he had been sent with "Russian ship, go F**k yourself" stitched onto them, in reference to the defiant defenders of Snake Island. For his birthday last week, the governor was given a convertible car with a captured Russian machine gun soldered onto its trunk, which his police chief still drives triumphantly around the city.

The problem, as CNN's national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow's engagement truly is -- even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation.

"Now, I think we all feel it personally," Sherman said, "but in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality." She added that the United States is "helping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met."

Put differently, it could be a while before Biden's "war criminal" remarks have any legal weight -- if ever.

As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea.

Later Monday, the NTSB said it "appointed a senior air safety investigator as a U.S. accredited representative to the investigation," which will be led by the CAAC.

He was detained after his arrival in Moscow from Berlin, where he had spent several months recovering from poisoning with nerve agent Novichok -- an attack he blames on Russian security services and on Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.

President Joe Biden issued an urgent and ominous warning to American individuals and businesses Monday, when he said "evolving intelligence" suggests Russia might be planning cyberattacks against the US.

The advisory is part of a growing chorus of warnings that US infrastructure is at risk, writes Lyngass.

Biden has more control over that consequence than he does over the preparedness of US companies that are involved in American infrastructure. He appealed to their sense of "patriotic obligation" to get their cyber-defense capabilities up to scratch.

"It may appear that the US is sitting by idly, but I would be highly doubtful that that's the case," she said, arguing that defensive actions might be more effective at de-escalating the standoff. "It's setting the example for what responsible state behavior looks like."

"So we could very easily find ourselves in a shooting war with Russia if they try devastating -- and that would have to be devastating -- cyberattacks like turning out the power grid," Clarke said.

But he added that NATO would be very careful in assessing an attack and would make sure a cyberattack on Ukraine -- shutting off electricity, say -- that accidentally spilled over into Poland or Romania is not construed as an attack on those countries.

Putin spokesman refuses to rule out use of nuclear weapons if Russia faced an 'existential threat'

The spokesman also claimed that the "special military operation" -- the Kremlin's official euphemism for Russia's invasion in Ukraine -- was "going on strictly in accordance with the plans and the purposes that were established before hand."

Washington's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has come as China pushes a more aggressive foreign policy, doubling down on its territorial claims, while taking a harder line in response to perceived challenges.

There, Ambassador Deng Xijun accused the US of "creating a set of 'gang rules' while claiming to uphold the international order" and taking the region "down an evil path," according to Chinese state-run media The Paper.

"Historically the female perspective has been precluded in this narrative of what the nude body means and how it should be shown," said Amanda Hajjar, the museum's director of exhibitions, in a phone interview. The show previously ran at the museum's Stockholm location and was curated by Johan Vikner.

"The nostrils of Spinosaurus is not at all placed like it is in animals like hippos and crocs, which spend much of their time submerged; instead, it is placed back on the skull as it is in herons and other animals which feed by dipping their snout in the water to feed," said Holz, who wasn't involved in the study.

The researchers, including scientists from the United States, Europe and Morocco, first compiled a database of sections of thigh bones and rib bones from a variety of animals to understand whether there was a universal correlation between bone density and behavior.

"Few leaders have been so perfectly suited for the times in which they served," Clinton said in a statement. "As a child in war-torn Europe, Madeleine and her family were twice forced to flee their home. When the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era of global interdependence, she became America's voice at the UN, then took the helm at the State Department, where she was a passionate force for freedom, democracy, and human rights."
